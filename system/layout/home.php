			<h1>Prologue</h1>
			<p>A journey that begun 10 years ago, each steps that we took, lead us into this path. Tons of pressures, scratches, tears and laughters, built & mould us. Priceless experience that we learned individually and from our friends and customers, grind us, made us who we are! Polished by the time, brought us into a new milestone of this journey.</p>
			<p>From the time Automobile was invented in 1769, it keep evolving and getting better and better within the time. Hundreds of years has past since the first milestone remarked by Karl Benz in 1886 that was regarded as the birth of the modern automobile. Now in this modern world, Automobile or known as Automotive nowadays, has shown a massive development, and yet it still shows its eager to satisfy the needs of man. I was wondering, can we make another remarkable milestone today?</p>
			<p>After a decade being in Automotive Industry, especially in Automotive Interior, making countless pieces of arts, influences, and touches the hearts of Automotive lovers, and yet, I still never get satisfied. I still dream to set our bar way even further, not only doing Automotive Interior, but bring it to a whole new level.</p>
